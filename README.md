# EventManageMent

This is a prototype app for event management in college
This app can register participants for the various events and also has a razorpay payment integration
By which they can pay and get registered for that particular event

Used Firebase as database

Now there is a admin side too so, if there is any new addition that can be added through the same app only 
there is no need to alter the database manually that can be done by the same app

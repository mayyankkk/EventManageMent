# EventManageMent

This is a prototype app for event management in college
This app can register participants for the various events and also has a razorpay payment integration
By which they participant can pay and get registered for that particular event

I've used firebase for storing and presenting the data


If the admin has to add new events they can simply add through the firebase. They don't have to change anything in the code.

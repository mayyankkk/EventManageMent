# EventManageMent

This is a prototype app for event management in college,
In this app participants can know about the events, it also has a razorpay payment integration
by which they can pay and get registered for that particular event and this app also has a discussion forum for participants.

All the events,messages,registrations etc are being saved in firebase

Now there is a admin side too so, if there is any new addition of event that can be added through the same app only 
there is no need to alter the database manually.

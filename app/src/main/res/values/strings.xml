    <string name="textV">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don\'t look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn\'t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from</string>

    <string name="boat_making_text">Ahoy there! Are you ready to put your boat-making skills to the test? Join us at Technoriti, the annual tech fest of Bhagalpur College of Engineering, for the exciting Boat Making event!

In this fun and challenging event, participants will design and build a boat from scratch using a variety of materials provided by the organizers. The boats will be judged based on their design, buoyancy, stability, and speed, among other factors. Participants will have to work together as a team to come up with the best design, and then use their engineering skills to bring it to life.

The Boat Making event is a great opportunity for students to showcase their creativity, technical knowledge, and teamwork skills. It also provides a platform for participants to learn from each other and exchange ideas, making it a great learning experience.

The event will take place in a specially designed area, complete with a water tank where participants can test their boats. Judges will evaluate each boat based on a set of criteria, and the winning team will receive a trophy, certificate, and other exciting prizes.

So, if you\'re looking for a fun and exciting way to showcase your boat-making skills and have a great time with your friends, come join us at Technoriti for the Boat Making event!
